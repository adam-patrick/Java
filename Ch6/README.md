Chapter 6  Value methods

Some of the methods we have used, like the Math methods, return values. But all the methods we have written so far have been void; that is, they don’t return values. In this chapter, we’ll write methods that return values, which we call value methods.

NOTE: I got mixed up here, and the above is actually from the First Edition.

Chapter 6  Loops and Strings
Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks, such as searching for text in documents. Repeating tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly.

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use while and for loops to add repetition to your code. We’ll also take a first look at String methods and solve some interesting problems.
