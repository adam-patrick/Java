# Snipit from Chapter 2:

This chapter describes how to write statements using variables, which store values like numbers and words, and operators, which are symbols that perform a computation. We also explain three kinds of programming errors and offer additional debugging advice.

To run the examples in this chapter, you will need to create a new Java class with a main method (see Section 1.3). Throughout the book, we often omit class and method definitions to keep the examples concise.
