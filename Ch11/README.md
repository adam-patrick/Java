# Chapter 11  Designing Classes

Whenever you create a new class, you are creating a new object type with the same name. So way back in Section 1.3, when we created the class Hello, we also created an object type named Hello.

We didn’t declare any variables with type Hello, and we didn’t use new to create Hello objects. And it wouldn’t have done much good if we had—but we could have!

In this chapter, you will learn to design classes that represent useful objects. Here are the main ideas:

Again, defining a class creates a new object type with the same name.

A class definition is a template for objects: it specifies what attributes the objects have and what methods can operate on them.

Every object belongs to an object type; that is, it is an instance of a class.

The new operator instantiates objects; that is, it creates new instances of a class.
Think of a class as a blueprint for a house: you can use the same blueprint to build any number of houses.
